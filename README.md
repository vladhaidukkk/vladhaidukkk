I'm Vlad, a backend developer from 🇺🇦 **Ukraine, Lviv** who loves working with Python. 💻 While I've dabbled in frontend, my true passion is creating robust and efficient server-side solutions.

🚀 I specialize in building scalable applications and optimizing databases. I enjoy the challenges of computer science, from algorithms to system architecture.
